# WashSafe - Wash Sale Prevention for Traders

**Stop losing money to wash sale violations!** WashSafe is a proactive trading tool that alerts you BEFORE you trigger IRS wash sale rules, helping you preserve your tax losses and optimize your trading strategy.

## üö® The Problem

Current trading platforms (Robinhood, E*TRADE, TD Ameritrade, etc.) only show wash sale violations **after** you've already triggered them. This means:

- ‚ùå Lost tax deductions you can't recover
- ‚ùå Unexpected tax surprises at year-end  
- ‚ùå Compliance headaches and record-keeping nightmares
- ‚ùå Missed opportunities for tax loss harvesting

## ‚úÖ The Solution

WashSafe gives you **real-time wash sale alerts** before you place trades, so you can:

- ‚úÖ Preserve valuable tax loss deductions
- ‚úÖ Plan your trades strategically around wash sale rules
- ‚úÖ Get "safe-to-buy" dates for each position
- ‚úÖ Track your tax impact throughout the year
- ‚úÖ Export clean records for your accountant

## üéØ Key Features

### Real-Time Wash Sale Detection
- **Before-trade alerts**: Know if a trade will trigger wash sale rules before you execute
- **30-day violation tracking**: Monitors purchases 30 days before and after sales
- **Visual warnings**: Clear red alerts for violations, green for safe trades

### Smart Portfolio Management
- **Current positions**: View all holdings with average cost basis
- **Safe-to-sell dates**: Know exactly when you can trade without wash sale risk
- **P&L tracking**: Real-time profit/loss on all positions

## üöÄ How It Works

## üßÆ Wash Sale Rules (IRS)

The IRS wash sale rule (Section 1091) states:

> If you sell stock at a loss and buy substantially identical stock within 30 days before or after the sale, the loss is disallowed for tax purposes.

**Key Points:**
- **30-day window**: 30 days before AND after the sale date (61 days total)
- **Substantially identical**: Same stock, options on same stock, similar securities
- **Loss disallowed**: Can't claim the tax deduction
- **Basis adjustment**: Lost amount gets added to cost basis of new shares

**Example:**
```
Oct 1:  Buy 100 AAPL at $200 = $20,000
Oct 15: Sell 100 AAPL at $150 = $15,000 (Loss: $5,000)
Oct 20: Buy 100 AAPL at $160 = $16,000

Result: $5,000 loss is disallowed, new cost basis = $21,000
```
